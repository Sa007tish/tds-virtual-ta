I understand it might start to sound like greek and latin for some of you, but we intentionally made the decision to have ML foundations as co-requisite. Because you can learn the theory and try to visit back and connect with the practice (tools) part. Some pointers which could be helpful for all of you having different perspectives (both positive and negative) -",

    "text": "The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.",
